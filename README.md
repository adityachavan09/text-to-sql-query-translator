# Text-to-SQL Query Translator
This project is a Jupyter Notebook designed to facilitate the conversion of natural language text into SQL queries. It is ideal for users who want to interact with databases using simple text inputs without requiring in-depth knowledge of SQL syntax.

## Features

Converts plain English text into SQL queries.

Supports complex query structures like filtering, joins, and aggregations.

Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) to interpret user input.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher

Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

The following Python libraries:

pandas

sqlparse

transformers

torch (if using a model requiring PyTorch)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas sqlparse transformers torch

## Setup

Clone this repository or download the notebook file (text-to-sql-query-translator.ipynb).

Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab:

jupyter notebook text-to-sql-query-translator.ipynb

Follow the instructions provided in the notebook cells to load your database schema and start using the translator.

## Usage

Define Your Database Schema: Update the notebook with your database schema. This ensures accurate SQL query generation.

Input Natural Language Query: Provide a text description of the desired database operation (e.g., "Show all employees who joined after 2020").

Generated SQL Query: The notebook will produce an SQL query corresponding to your input.

Execute Query (optional): If a database connection is set up, you can execute the generated query directly from the notebook.

## Example

### Input:

Find the total sales by each salesperson in 2023.

### Generated SQL Query:

SELECT salesperson, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales_table
WHERE YEAR(sale_date) = 2023
GROUP BY salesperson;

Customization

Model Fine-Tuning: If using a machine learning model, you can fine-tune it with your specific database queries for better accuracy.

Database Integration: Modify the notebook to include a live database connection using libraries like sqlite3 or sqlalchemy.
